## 📍 Scope
This project develops a **real-time monocular depth enhancement** system for **AR occlusion** in mixed reality headsets.  
It fine-tunes lightweight monocular depth models (MiDaS / Depth Anything) with **temporal smoothing** and **self-supervised adaptation**,  
aiming for temporally stable, spatially accurate, and efficient depth estimation suitable for **mobile or embedded AR GPUs**.

**Key Metrics:**  
- RMSE, AbsRel (accuracy)  
- SSIM (structural similarity)  
- Temporal Flicker Index (stability)  
- Latency (end-to-end <50 ms)

|------|--------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Baseline model setup | Artyom Tsay | Artyom Tsay | — | Instructor, TA |
| Temporal smoothing integration | Artyom Tsay | Artyom Tsay | — | Instructor |
| Self-supervised tuning | Artyom Tsay | Artyom Tsay | — | Instructor |

## 🧮 Success Criteria
- **≥10% RMSE improvement** vs baseline  
- **<50 ms** per-frame latency  
- **SSIM ≥ 0.90**  
- **Reduced temporal flicker (≥20% stability gain)**  
- Visually smoother occlusion boundaries in demo video

## ⚠️ Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|
| Limited GPU resources | Use LoRA fine-tuning and reduced model variants |
| Temporal instability under motion | Optical flow correction or EMA smoothing |
| Domain mismatch between synthetic and real data | Synthetic-to-real adaptation, pseudo-stereo tuning |
| Latency exceeding real-time threshold | Quantization and ONNX optimization |
| Insufficient visual improvement | Combine perceptual loss and temporal loss terms |
